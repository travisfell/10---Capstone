## Introduction
Show word counts, line counts, basic data tables
Plot features of the data
Exploratory analysis
Interesting findings so far
Prediction model concerns

Below are the line counts for the three US files. 

* The US blogs file has 899,288 lines and approximately 4,799,000 words. 

* The US news file has 1,010,242 lines and approximately 886,300 words.

* The US Twitter file has 2,360,148 lines and approximately 4,424,800 words. 

Note: The analysis sampled 1% of the text files. Thus, the word counts above are estimates based on the sampled files.  

## Exploratory Analysis
To prepare the text files for exploratory analysis, I used the following code to 

1. Combined the three files. 

  + Addressed some issues with apostrophes in the text

2. Converted the files to a corpus. 

3. Executed common pre-processing steps.

4. Created a TermDocumentMatrix. 

Upon completing the aforementioned pre-processing, I found the following frequencies of words, bigrams and trigrams (top 30 of each shown). 

Top 30 single terms:
![](WordFreq.png) 

Top 30 bigrams: 
![](bigramFreq.png) 

Top 30 trigrams
![](trigramFreq.png) 

There is still some clean up required for handling contractions. 

## Thoughts on the Prediction Model
My current thoughts on how to build the keystroke prediction algorithm required for the final deliverable are something like this:

As the user keys in characters, compare the string to the terms isolated from the corpus to see if the term exists. 

If the word does exist in the corpus:

1. Compare it to the known bigrams. 
  
2. If the word matches any bigrams on the first word, show the top 5 by frequency. 
      
   a. If the user selects one of the bigrams, compare that bigram to the list of trigrams
      
      * If the bigram matches the first two words of any trigrams, show the top 5 trigrams by frequency.
      
      * If the bigram does not match the first two words of any trigram, run a correlation on the bigram to other words in the corpus and show any that have a 80% correlation or higher. 
        
      * If the bigram does not correlate at or above 80% with any other term, present the top 5 most frequent words from an open source word frequency list that do not match any word in the corpus. 
  
  b. If the word does not match any bigrams, run a correlation on the word to other words in the corpus and show any that have a 80% correlation or higher.
  
  c. If the word does not correlate at or above 80% with any other term, present the top 5 most frequent words from an open source word frequency list that do not match any word in the corpus. 
  
3. If the word does not exist in the corpus, present top 5 most frequent words from an open source word frequency list that do not match any word in the corpus.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
